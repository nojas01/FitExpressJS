Simple express app to work with .gpx files

##  work in progress:
this is a hobbyproject in progress. 
The goal is to make a strava like combination with a react native app.
It will collect gps and sensor data on a phone and then send it to this api.
The API will then store this data so that it can be reviewed later using a get request.
